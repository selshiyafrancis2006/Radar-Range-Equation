<h1>EVALUATION OF RADAR RANGE USING PYTHON</h1>

<h2>Aim</h2>
To calculate the maximum range of a radar system using the Radar Range Equation and verify the results through Python programming.

<h2>Theory</h2>

The Radar Range Equation is a fundamental formula used in radar system design to determine the maximum range at which a radar can detect a target. It is given by:

<h2>Procedure</h2>

1.Set Up the Python Environment: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can use Anaconda for managing Python packages and environments, or any other Python IDE of your choice.
2.Import Necessary Libraries: Import the math library in Python.
3.Define the Radar Range Equation Function: Create a function to calculate the maximum range using the Radar Range Equation.
4.Input Parameters for the Radar System: Define the input parameters such as transmitted power, transmitter gain, receiver gain, radar frequency, radar cross section, and minimum detectable power.
5.Calculate the Maximum Range: Use the function to calculate the maximum range of the radar.
6.Execute the Program: Run the Python script to calculate and display the maximum range of the radar.
